    Now that we've exchanged the relevant keys, it's time to start on the transactions
    The host is supposed to create the lock, the refund, and the spend, signing the refund

    Then, the whitepaper says to transmit all three, so the client can verify everything
    That said, the client can't properly verify the lock
    They'd need to verify its inputs exist and are correct, have the correct script, and has a valid signature
    If the client can properly verify this transaction chain, they can publish the lock
    If the client can publish the lock, before the host has their refund signature, the client can lose nothing while causing the host to lose everything

    To solve this problem, the client has to wait to verify the lock
    That said, they only need the lock at this time to sign the refund/spend transaction for the host
    They can do this solely knowing the lock's transaction ID
    Since they generate new keys, they can blindly trust the provided TX ID, as there's no risk of being tricked into signing over our own funds
    While we could have the client do a partial verification of the lock now, they'd still have to verify it again later
    As of right now, there's no security risk in putting this off

    If we want to remove the risk of having the client sign over their own funds, in case they do have other funds
    We can have them receive the lock transaction, do a partial verification, and recalculate the ID
    Since they never sign the lock itself, even if the lock spends their funds, they'll be secure

    It should also be noted the refund and spend don't need to be transmitted
    Their only meaningful info is the keys used for them, which was included in the above key transmission
    That said, the refund signature does still need to be transmitted
